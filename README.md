# Dark++
Highly customized dark and purple theme for discord, a fork of Dark+ by DevEvil99.

Updated to have a slightly more consistent design, and to remove the messenger like chat.

# Todo: 
Edit the event section to be updated
Edit the school/uni section to be updated
Probably some other tweaks
I might make it easier to tweak fine details going forwards, give more control to the user.

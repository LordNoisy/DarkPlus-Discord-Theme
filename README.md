# Dark++
Highly customized dark and purple theme for discord, a fork of Dark+ by DevEvil99.

Updated to have a slightly more consistent design, and to remove the messenger like chat.<br>
# Improvements Over Dark+: 
- Fixed the educational hub thing to be consistent with theme
- Fixed settings to be consistent with theme
- Many small tweaks to make the theme consistent
- No messenger like chat blocks
- Easy to edit

# Todo:
- Update the preview
- Update logo both in theme and in client
